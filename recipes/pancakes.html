<h1>Description :</h1>
<h2>Ingredients :</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda </li>
    <li>1 large ripe banana</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup milk</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>½ cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps :</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk. Reserve until needed.</li>
    <li>Place banana in a mixing bowl and mash into a smooth paste with a potato masher. Add egg and sugar and whisk thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add milk, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined.</li>
    <li>Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, transfer in about 1/3 cup of the batter per pancake. Reduce heat to medium and cook until edges start to look dry and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
